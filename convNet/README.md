# SunNN 

SunNN is a small project about neural network. This project contain perceptron and the simple discussion about convolutional neuron network. the require is adapting on all sub-program.

## Conclusion

The two program discuss the result of the following address:

The JS graph show the progress of the dot process between input volume and the weight spacial. But the result might wrong(the green region). This project show the result I testing. If you have the other opinion, you can raise the issue to tell me.
